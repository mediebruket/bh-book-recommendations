Provides shortcode and widget for displaying book recommendations from RSS feed.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a simple shortcode and a widget which enables you to display book recommendations from RSS feeds on your website.

The plugin is written primarily to work with the book recommendations feed from the [Norwegian Deichman](http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/lag-lister) library.

The plugin uses the main Deichman RSS feed as default: `http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/`. But this can be changed by supplying a new URL as argument to the shortcode or added in the widget configuration.
