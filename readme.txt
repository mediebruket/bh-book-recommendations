Provides shortcode and widget for displaying book recommendations from RSS feed.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a simple shortcode and a widget which enables you to display book recommendations from RSS feeds on your website. So it's basically a very simple RSS plugin.

The plugin is written primarily to work with the book recommendations feed from the Norwegian [Deichman](http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/lag-lister) library.

The plugin uses the main Deichman RSS feed as default: `http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/`. But this can be changed by supplying a new URL as argument to the shortcode or added in the widget configuration.

The plugin is available in English, Norwegian bokm√•l and Norwegian nynorsk.

The development of this plugin is sponsored by [Hordaland Fylkeskommune](http://www.hfk.no/).

== Installation ==

Download to `wp-content/plugins/` and activate.

Insert into post or page with shortcode: `[bhbook]`. The shortcode uses the main Deichman RSS feed `http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/feed` as default.

Customize the results by creating a custom feed at `http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/lag-lister`. Copy the generated feed URL and use as argument to the shortcode like this: `[bhbook url=http://anbefalinger.deichman.no/feed?authors=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.deichman.no%2Fperson%2Fx10532400]`.

As per version 0.1 the plugin has two different modes of displaying the feed, namely *list* and *grid*, where the former is default.

In order to change display to grid, use the display argument in the shortcode, for example like this: `[bhbook display="grid"]`.

Additionally, there is also a widget available. Custom feed URL can be utilized as described above.
